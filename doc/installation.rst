Installation
============

In order to use `openbandparams`, you must having a working python_
distribution installed. Python 3 support has not yet been tested,
so Python 2.7 is suggested. Here are a couple different ways to
install `openbandparams`:

1. Download the latest release `.zip` or `.tar.gz` source package from
   the `github page`_, extract its contents, and run
   `python setup.py install` from within the extracted directory
   (openbandparams is a pure-python library, so no compiling occurs
   during this installation).

2. Install from pypi_ by running `pip install openbandparams` from the
   command line.

Basic functionality has no prerequisites other than python, but several of
the examples make use of numpy_ and matplotlib_, so you may want to install
them, as well.

Once you have `openbandparams` installed, check out the :doc:`tutorial` to
get acquainted.
