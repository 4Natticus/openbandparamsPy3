    Finds the root of `func` using the bisection method.

    Requirements
    ------------
    - func must be continuous function that accepts a single number input
      and returns a single number
    - `func(a)` and `func(b)` must have opposite sign

    Parameters
    ----------
    func : function
        the function that we want to find the root of
    a : number
        one of the bounds on the input
    b : number
        the other bound on the input
    xtol : number, optional
        the solution tolerance of the input value. The algorithm is
        considered converged if `abs(b-a)2. < xtol`
    maxiter : number, optional
        the maximum number of iterations allowed for convergence
