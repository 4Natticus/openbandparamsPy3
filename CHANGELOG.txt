Changes in 0.9:

- added `dielectric` and `dielectric_high_frequency` parameters
- added `meff_e_L_DOS` and `meff_e_X_DOS` parameters
- improved error messages
- fixed `MethodParameter.get_references` endless loop
- fixed `nonparabolicity` parameter (temperature dependence was wrong)
- fixed `luttinger32` parameter
- fixed lattice matching of type 3 quaternatries

Changes in 0.8:

- Near complete rewrite of internals
- Parameters now have units, aliases, descriptions and references
- Strained alloy interface is much cleaner
  (see `examples/Strained_Ternaries`)
- Ternaries of ternaries are now possible
  (see `examples/Ternaries_of_Ternaries`)
- Alloy interpolation now follows the recommendations from
  Vurgaftman, et al. (2001).
- Added and renamed several parameters and methods
- Fixed Ternaries requiring lattice matching temperature

Changes in 0.7:

- Added several functions for calculating the effects of biaxial strain
- Added a strained binaries band offsets vs lattice constant example
- Added several advanced examples
- Fixed the strained binaries bandgap vs lattice constant
  example (the strain effects were reversed)
- Fixed bug with AlGaN, AlInN, and GaInN caused by having extraneous commas

Changes in 0.6:

- Fixed a packaging issue that prevented setup.py from working

Changes in 0.5:

- Lattice matching temperature is no longer required (defaults to 300 K)
- Added the heavy and light hole effective mass parameters
- Added some new example scripts
- Added quaternary bowing
- Adjusted the InAsSb VBO bowing parameter
- Added some literature references as comments
- Fixed examples not loading local openbandparams

Changes in 0.4:

- Added quaternaries
- Added strained binaries example
- Added 'elements' property and 'elementFraction' method
- Implemented __all__, so that 'from openbandparams import *' works
- Moved examples into the openbandparams package
- Lots of internal changes (refactoring, documentation, etc.)

Changes in 0.3:

- Added ternary lattice matching

Changes in 0.2:

- Improved usability of ternaries
- Changed all methods to require key word arguments
- Added documentation
